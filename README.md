Yet another automatic minesweeper solver
========================================

The whole project is structured into two big parts
 - mineswooper, the minesweeper solver and
 - minesweeper, a simple windows minesweeper clone.

Main purpose of this project is to learn and understand the basic principles of minesweeper, git, image recognition and of course writing bots and scripts for computer games.

Have fun using it, but don't blame me if my bot ruins your "nearly solved" minesweeper round.
